Every aspect of the trip unfolded seamlessly, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the beauty of the country, the incredible gorillas, our exceptional guide, and most notably, its people. While the gorilla and chimpanzee treks were undeniably brilliant, we were equally impressed by the warmth of the Rwandan people and the stunning countryside and scenery that surrounded us. This holiday far exceeded all our expectation"
