                Tsavo National Park is a major tourist destination in Kenya located in the south-western part of the country. It consists of two separate parks, Tsavo East and Tsavo West, which are separated by a railway line. The park is famous for its man-eating lions, which were known for attacking construction workers during the building of the railway. The park spans an area of 13,747 square kilometers and offers visitors a diverse landscape, including rugged mountains in Tsavo West and semi-arid grasslands and savannah in Tsavo East, where visitors can see various wildlife species.
                <br/><br/>Although the park is home to the "big 5" animals, the dense bush and hilly terrain can make wildlife viewing a bit challenging. However, there are fewer crowds in this wilderness area, making the safari experience more authentic.
                <br/> <br/>The park boasts some spectacular scenic highlights, including the dramatic black lava fields, imposing cones, and Mzima Springs, where visitors can see hippos underwater. The majestic Mt Kilimanjaro can be seen in the background on clear days, and a forest walk in the undulating Chyulu Hills is a delightful experience.
                <br/> <br/>Visitors to the park will easily see an abundance of African savannah elephants,Black rhinoceros,hippos,klipspringer,giraffes, zebras,fringe-eared, eland, , lesser kudu,  oryx, shy gerenuks, and the blue wildebeest. The park also offers good lion sightings, and visitors may even be lucky enough to elusive spot a leopard.
                Bird watching in Tsavo is exceptional, with over 400 species on the checklist, including many dry-country specials. The Finch Hatton's luxury tented camp provides a great base for exploring the park and visitors may see a variety of birds such as the African wood owl,Green wood-hoopoe, Kori, Yellow-throated and Black-faced sandgrouse, Martial eagle, Von der Decken's hornbill, Purple grenadiers, Northern carmine bee-eater, Red-and-yellow barbet, Retz' helmet-shrike, Red-faced crombec, Northern brownbul, Violet-backed and Ruppell's starlings, Silverbird, Bronze sunbird, and and Black-bellied bustards,
